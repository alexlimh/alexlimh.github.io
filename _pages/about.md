I'm a previous MTS at **Cohere**, working on foundation models for embeddings and search. 
I obtained my Ph.D. from the **University of Waterloo**, supervised by Professor 
[Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html). Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science 
from **University of Toronto** under the supervision of [Danijar Hafner](https://danijar.com/) and Professor 
[Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate study at **Sun Yat-Sen University** 
advised by Professor [Weishi Zheng](https://www.isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/).
