I'm a CS PhD student (3rd year) at Universtiy of Waterloo, supervised by Professor [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html). Before that, I received my MSc in Computer Science from University of Toronto under the supervision of [Danijar Hafner](https://danijar.com/) and Professor [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate study at Sun Yat-Sen University advised by Professor [Weishi Zheng](https://www.isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/).  

I am interested in building efficient, scalable, and robust neural models for information retrieval and its downstream applications. My research goal is to design task-aware retrievers to help large language models efficiently aggregate knowledge from large, unstructured databases.

- 2022-02-13: New paper out! [SLIM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06587.pdf) manages to reduce the latency and storage of ColBERT while being fully compatible with Pyserini (Lucene-based). Codes will be released soon!
- 2022-02-13: New paper out! We find that adding contextualized late interaction could be helpful for cross-encoders on out-of-domain generalization. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06589.pdf) and some discussion on [tweeter](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/1626232873190821890).
