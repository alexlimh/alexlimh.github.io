I'm a Member of Technical Staff at Cohere, working on foundation models for embeddings and search. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, supervised by Professor [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html). Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from University of Toronto under the supervision of [Danijar Hafner](https://danijar.com/) and Professor [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate study at Sun Yat-Sen University advised by Professor [Weishi Zheng](https://www.isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/).

- 2023-05-02: Our paper [CITADEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10411) is accepted in ACL 2023! Check out this efficient multi-vector retriever which i about 40x faster than ColBERT-v2 on GPUs. 
- 2022-02-13: New paper is out! [SLIM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06587.pdf) manages to reduce the latency and storage of ColBERT while being fully compatible with Pyserini (Lucene-based). Codes will be released soon!
- 2022-02-13: New paper is out! We find that adding contextualized late interaction could be helpful for cross-encoders on out-of-domain generalization. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06589.pdf) and some discussion on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/1626232873190821890).
