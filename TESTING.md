# üß™ Testing the Modernized Site

## Quick Local Test (Recommended)

Since the development environment doesn't have Ruby/Jekyll installed, here's how to test on your local machine:

### Option 1: Simple Jekyll Setup
```bash
# In your local terminal (not the IDE):
cd /path/to/alexlimh.github.io

# Install dependencies
bundle install
npm install

# Build assets  
npm run build

# Start development server
./dev.sh
# or manually: bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Open http://localhost:4000
```

### Option 2: Docker (if you prefer containers)
```bash
# Create a simple Dockerfile for testing
echo "FROM ruby:3.1
WORKDIR /site
COPY . .
RUN bundle install && npm install && npm run build
EXPOSE 4000
CMD bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0" > Dockerfile

# Build and run
docker build -t academic-site .
docker run -p 4000:4000 academic-site
```

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)  
- [ ] Safari (if on Mac)
- [ ] Resize window to test responsive breakpoints

### Mobile Testing  
- [ ] Test on actual mobile device or browser dev tools
- [ ] Portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Touch interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Check browser dev tools Network tab
- [ ] Lighthouse audit (aim for 90+ scores)
- [ ] Test with slow 3G simulation

## üöÄ Expected Results

You should see a **dramatically improved** site with:
- **Professional modern design** instead of basic academic template
- **Engaging visual hierarchy** with cards, colors, and spacing  
- **Smooth interactions** with hover effects and animations
- **Mobile-first responsive design** that works beautifully on all devices
- **Enhanced content presentation** that showcases your research effectively

If something doesn't look right, check the browser console for errors and refer to the troubleshooting section above.

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript/CSS errors
2. Verify all dependencies installed correctly
3. Try the manual setup steps instead of the `./dev.sh` script
4. Make sure you're viewing `http://localhost:4000` (not https)

The transformation should be immediately visible - your old plain academic site will now have a modern, professional appearance! üéâ
